# OpenVALE Lite

OpenVALE Lite is a simple framework for researchers to evaluate HRTFs for audio spatialization. The Lite version of OpenVALE removes the need to write experiment scripts and set up an OpenVALE server. Instead, OpenVALE Lite is self-contained and allows researchers to run the most common types of experiments performed in the original OpenVALE. There is still a wide range of options for experiments, most of which can be adjusted during a session.

For the original OpenVALE project, see https://gitlab.com/OpenVALE/OpenVALE.
